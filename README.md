Without trust and understanding, models run a real risk of becoming shelf-ware or being misused. Additionally, the growing awareness of model ethics and bias is placing added emphasis on explainable models. An understanding of the concepts around model explainability is vital to the success of any data scientist or data science organizational strategy.
